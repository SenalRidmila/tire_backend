# 📧 SendGrid Email Service Setup Guide

## 🎯 Goal
Enable manager email notifications when tire requests are submitted, bypassing Render's SMTP restrictions.

## 📝 Steps to Complete Setup:

### 1. Create SendGrid Account (FREE)
1. **Visit**: https://sendgrid.com/
2. **Sign up** with your email
3. **Choose "Free" plan** (100 emails/day - perfect for this app)
4. **Verify your account** via email

### 2. Get SendGrid API Key
1. **Login to SendGrid Dashboard**
2. **Go to**: Settings → API Keys
3. **Click**: "Create API Key"
4. **Name**: "Tire Management System"
5. **Permissions**: "Full Access" (or just Mail Send)
6. **Copy the API Key** (starts with `SG.`)

### 3. Add API Key to Render Environment
1. **Go to your Render Dashboard**: https://dashboard.render.com/
2. **Find your "tire-backend-58a9" service**
3. **Go to**: Environment tab
4. **Add New Environment Variable**:
   - **Key**: `SENDGRID_API_KEY`
   - **Value**: `SG.your_api_key_here` (the key from step 2)
5. **Click**: "Save Changes"
6. **Render will redeploy automatically**

### 4. Test the Implementation

After deployment, test these endpoints:

```bash
# Check SendGrid configuration
GET https://tire-backend-58a9.onrender.com/api/email-test/test-sendgrid

# Compare email services
GET https://tire-backend-58a9.onrender.com/api/email-test/services-status

# Test actual tire request submission
POST https://tire-backend-58a9.onrender.com/api/tire-requests
```

### 5. Verify Email Sending

1. **Submit a tire request** on https://tire-slt.vercel.app
2. **Check slthrmanager@gmail.com** for notification email
3. **Monitor logs** in Render dashboard for email status

## 🔧 Current Implementation

The system now has **dual email support**:
- **Primary**: SendGrid (cloud-compatible) 
- **Fallback**: Gmail SMTP (local development)

When a tire request is submitted:
1. ✅ **Try SendGrid first** (will work on Render)
2. 🔄 **Fall back to Gmail SMTP** (if SendGrid fails)
3. ✅ **Request still saves** (even if both email services fail)

## 🧪 Testing Flow

1. **Form submission** → ✅ Working
2. **Data storage** → ✅ Working  
3. **Email notification** → 🔄 Needs SendGrid API key
4. **Manager dashboard** → ✅ Ready
5. **Full workflow** → ⏳ Pending email setup
