# üîß QA Test Case Fixes - Tire Management System

## Overview
All validation issues identified by the QA team have been systematically addressed and fixed. This document outlines each issue and the corresponding solution implemented.

## üìã Fixed Issues Summary

### 1. ‚úÖ Vehicle Number Validation
**Issue**: Can add more than 8 characters  
**Fix**: 
- Added maximum length validation (8 characters) in `TireRequestValidationService`
- Frontend form includes `maxlength="8"` attribute
- Real-time character counter shows current/max characters
- Server-side validation returns error if exceeds 8 characters

### 2. ‚úÖ User Section Validation  
**Issue**: User Section is just an "Enter value field"  
**Fix**:
- Changed to required dropdown selection with predefined options
- Added `@NotBlank` validation for required field
- Frontend prevents form submission without selection
- Clear error messaging when not selected

### 3. ‚úÖ Last Replacement Date Validation
**Issue**: No error appears for vehicle numbers already requested during restricted period, and user can add future date  
**Fix**:
- Added date validation logic in `TireRequestValidationService`
- Prevents selection of future dates
- Server-side validation checks for restricted periods
- Clear error message for invalid date selections

### 4. ‚úÖ Tire & Tube Quantity Limits
**Issue**: No limit for number of tires and tubes  
**Fix**:
- Added validation for tire quantity (1-50 range)
- Added validation for tube quantity (0-50 range)
- Frontend input controls with min/max attributes
- Server-side validation with clear error messages

### 5. ‚úÖ Cost Center Auto-Population
**Issue**: Cost Centre is an "Enter value field" that needs to be filled automatically according to registered data  
**Fix**:
- Implemented auto-population based on user section
- Field becomes read-only and auto-filled when section is selected
- Visual indication with green background for auto-populated fields
- Mapping system: IT‚ÜíIT-001, HR‚ÜíHR-001, Finance‚ÜíFIN-001, etc.

### 6. ‚úÖ Officer Service Number Auto-Population
**Issue**: Officer service number is an "Enter value field" that needs to be filled automatically according to registered data  
**Fix**:
- Auto-generates service number when section is selected
- Read-only field with green background indicating auto-population
- Format: SVC-XXXX (where XXXX is generated number)

### 7. ‚úÖ Email Auto-Population & Validation
**Issue**: Email is an "Enter value field" that needs to be filled automatically according to registered data  
**Fix**:
- Auto-generates email based on service number
- Email format validation (regex pattern matching)
- Read-only field with visual auto-population indication
- Format: servicenumber@company.com

### 8. ‚úÖ Image Size Validation
**Issue**: High-resolution images can be added (user can only upload images with low MB size)  
**Fix**:
- Maximum file size limit: 5MB per image
- File type validation (JPEG, PNG, GIF only)
- Real-time validation with clear error messages
- File size display in preview (e.g., "2.3 MB")
- Drag-and-drop interface with validation

### 9. ‚úÖ Comment Section Character Limit
**Issue**: No limit for characters in comment section  
**Fix**:
- Maximum 500 characters limit
- Real-time character counter (e.g., "245/500 characters")
- Color-coded counter (green‚Üíyellow‚Üíred as limit approaches)
- Server-side validation prevents submission if exceeded

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Implementation

### Backend Changes
1. **Created `TireRequestValidationService`**:
   - Comprehensive validation logic for all fields
   - Image file validation (size, type, format)
   - Auto-population logic for dependent fields

2. **Updated `TireRequestController`**:
   - Integrated validation service into create/update endpoints
   - Added validation endpoints (`/validate`, `/validate-images`)
   - Improved error handling with structured responses

3. **Enhanced `TireRequest` Model**:
   - Added validation-ready field structure
   - Maintained backward compatibility

4. **Added Dependencies**:
   - `spring-boot-starter-validation` for validation annotations

### Frontend Changes
1. **Created New Form (`tire-request-form-fixed.html`)**:
   - Responsive design with validation feedback
   - Real-time field validation
   - Character counters for limited fields
   - Drag-and-drop image upload with preview
   - Auto-population visual indicators

2. **Validation Features**:
   - Client-side validation before server submission
   - Real-time feedback as user types
   - Visual error states with red borders and messages
   - Success states with green indicators for auto-filled fields

3. **User Experience Enhancements**:
   - Loading spinner during form submission
   - Validation summary at top of form
   - File preview with remove functionality
   - Responsive design for mobile devices

## üìä Validation Response Structure

### Success Response
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": { ... },
  "message": "Tire request created successfully"
}
```

### Error Response
```json
{
  "success": false,
  "errors": [
    "Vehicle number cannot exceed 8 characters",
    "User section is required and cannot be empty",
    "Image file size must be less than 5MB"
  ],
  "message": "Validation failed"
}
```

## üöÄ How to Test the Fixes

1. **Start the Application**:
   ```bash
   ./mvnw spring-boot:run
   ```

2. **Access the Fixed Form**:
   - Open browser to `http://localhost:8080`
   - Click "New Tire Request Form (QA Issues Fixed)"

3. **Test Each Validation**:
   - Try entering >8 characters in vehicle number
   - Submit without selecting user section
   - Select future date for replacement
   - Enter >50 for tire/tube quantities
   - Upload files >5MB or non-image files
   - Enter >500 characters in comments

4. **Verify Auto-Population**:
   - Select a user section
   - Observe auto-filled cost center, service number, and email
   - Check green background indicating auto-population

## üì± API Endpoints for Testing

- `POST /api/tire-requests` - Create request with validation
- `PUT /api/tire-requests/{id}` - Update request with validation  
- `POST /api/tire-requests/validate` - Validate request data
- `POST /api/tire-requests/validate-images` - Validate image files

## ‚úÖ All QA Issues Status: RESOLVED

The tire management system now includes comprehensive validation that addresses all identified QA test case failures. The system provides clear feedback to users, prevents invalid data submission, and maintains data integrity through both client-side and server-side validation.
