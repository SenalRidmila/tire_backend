# üîß QA Test Case Fixes - User Dashboard Issues
**Date:** October 6, 2025  
**Status:** COMPLETED ‚úÖ  

## üìã Fixed Issues Summary

### 1. ‚úÖ Vehicle Number Validation (Enhanced)
**Issue:** Can add more than 8 characters  
**Fix:** 
- Added `maxLength="8"` attribute to HTML input field
- Client-side validation prevents typing beyond 8 characters
- Server-side validation returns error if exceeds 8 characters
- Real-time validation shows error message immediately

**Code Changes:**
```javascript
// Frontend: RequestForm.js
maxLength={field.name === 'vehicleNo' ? 8 : undefined}

// Validation:
case 'vehicleNo':
  if (!value.trim()) return 'This field is required';
  if (value.length > 8) return 'Vehicle number cannot exceed 8 characters';
```

### 2. ‚úÖ User Section - Dropdown Implementation  
**Issue:** User Section is just an "Enter value field"  
**Fix:**
- Changed from text input to required dropdown selection
- Added predefined department options
- Auto-populates Cost Center and Officer Service Number
- Clear validation messaging when not selected

**Code Changes:**
```javascript
// Dropdown Options:
<select name="userSection" required>
  <option value="">Please select your section (Required)</option>
  <option value="IT">IT Department</option>
  <option value="HR">Human Resources</option>
  <option value="Finance">Finance Department</option>
  // ... more departments
</select>

// Auto-population mapping:
const sectionMappings = {
  'IT': { costCenter: '1001', officerServiceNo: 'IT001' },
  'HR': { costCenter: '1002', officerServiceNo: 'HR001' },
  // ... complete mapping
};
```

### 3. ‚úÖ Last Replacement Date Validation  
**Issue:** No error appears for future dates + allows future date input  
**Fix:**
- Added future date validation on both client and server side
- Clear error message when future date is selected
- Prevents form submission with invalid dates

**Code Changes:**
```javascript
// Frontend validation:
if (name === 'replacementDate' && value) {
  const selectedDate = new Date(value);
  const today = new Date();
  if (selectedDate > today) {
    return 'Cannot set future dates for vehicles already requested during restricted periods';
  }
}

// Backend validation:
if (requestedDate.after(currentDate)) {
    errors.add("Cannot set replacement date in the future for vehicles already requested during restricted periods");
}
```

### 4. ‚úÖ Tire & Tube Quantity Limits  
**Issue:** There is no limit for number of tires and tubes  
**Fix:**
- Added range validation: Tires (1-50), Tubes (0-50)
- HTML input includes `max="50"` attribute
- Client and server-side validation enforces limits
- Clear error messages for out-of-range values

**Code Changes:**
```javascript
// Tire validation:
case 'noOfTires':
  const tireNum = parseInt(value);
  if (tireNum < 1 || tireNum > 50) return 'Number of tires must be between 1 and 50';

// Tube validation:
case 'noOfTubes':
  const tubeNum = parseInt(value);
  if (tubeNum < 0 || tubeNum > 50) return 'Number of tubes must be between 0 and 50';

// HTML attributes:
max={field.name === 'noOfTires' || field.name === 'noOfTubes' ? 50 : undefined}
```

### 5. ‚úÖ Cost Center Auto-Population  
**Issue:** Cost Center is an Enter value field that needs to be filled automatically according to registered data  
**Fix:**
- Auto-populates based on selected User Section
- Each department has predefined cost center code
- Field becomes read-only after auto-population
- Maintains data consistency across requests

**Implementation:**
```javascript
const sectionMappings = {
  'IT': { costCenter: '1001' },
  'HR': { costCenter: '1002' },
  'Finance': { costCenter: '1003' },
  'Operations': { costCenter: '1004' },
  // ... complete mapping for all 10 departments
};
```

### 6. ‚úÖ Officer Service Number Auto-Population  
**Issue:** Officer service number is an Enter value field that needs to be filled automatically according to registered data  
**Fix:**
- Auto-generates based on selected User Section
- Each department has predefined service number pattern
- Consistent format: [DEPT][001] (e.g., IT001, HR001)
- Links with email auto-generation

### 7. ‚úÖ Email Auto-Population & Validation  
**Issue:** Email is an Enter value field that needs to be filled automatically according to registered data  
**Fix:**
- Auto-generates email based on Officer Service Number
- Format: [serviceno]@company.com (e.g., it001@company.com)
- Validates email format with regex pattern
- Ensures consistent company email addresses

### 8. ‚úÖ Image Size Validation  
**Issue:** High-resolution images can be added (The user can only upload images with a low MB size)  
**Fix:**
- Added 5MB file size limit per image
- Validates file type (JPEG, JPG, PNG, GIF only)
- Clear error messages for oversized files
- Prevents upload of invalid file types

**Code Changes:**
```javascript
// File validation:
const maxSize = 5 * 1024 * 1024; // 5MB in bytes
const oversizedFiles = files.filter(file => file.size > maxSize);

if (oversizedFiles.length > 0) {
  alert('Image file size must be less than 5MB. Please select smaller images.');
  return;
}

const allowedTypes = ['image/jpeg', 'image/jpg', 'image/png', 'image/gif'];
const invalidFiles = files.filter(file => !allowedTypes.includes(file.type));

if (invalidFiles.length > 0) {
  alert('Only image files (JPEG, JPG, PNG, GIF) are allowed');
  return;
}
```

### 9. ‚úÖ Comment Section Size Validation  
**Issue:** No limit for characters in the comment section  
**Fix:**
- Added 500 character limit for comments
- Real-time character counter (if implemented in UI)
- Validation prevents submission of overly long comments
- Clear error message when limit exceeded

**Code Changes:**
```javascript
case 'comments':
  if (value && value.length > 500) return 'Comments cannot exceed 500 characters';
```
