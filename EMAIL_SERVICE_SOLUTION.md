# 📧 Email Service Solution Guide

## 🚫 Current Issue
The Gmail SMTP connection is being blocked by Render's security policies. This is a common issue with cloud hosting platforms.

## ✅ Status Check
- ✅ **Backend Deployment**: Working perfectly
- ✅ **Form Submission**: Data saves to MongoDB successfully  
- ✅ **Image Display**: All working with fallbacks
- ❌ **Email Service**: SMTP connection blocked by Render

## 🛠️ Solution Options

### Option 1: Alternative Email Services (Recommended)
Use cloud-based email services that work better with Render:

#### A. SendGrid (Most Popular)
1. **Sign up**: https://sendgrid.com/
2. **Get API Key**: Free tier allows 100 emails/day
3. **Add dependency** to `pom.xml`:
```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.sendgrid</groupId>
    <artifactId>sendgrid-java</artifactId>
    <version>4.9.3</version>
</dependency>
```

#### B. Mailgun
1. **Sign up**: https://www.mailgun.com/
2. **Free tier**: 5,000 emails/month
3. **REST API**: Works well with cloud platforms

#### C. Amazon SES
1. **AWS Simple Email Service**
2. **Pay-per-use**: Very cost effective
3. **High deliverability**: Enterprise grade

### Option 2: Environment Variables (Try First)
Add these to Render environment variables:

```
SPRING_MAIL_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
SPRING_MAIL_PORT=587
SPRING_MAIL_USERNAME=slthrmanager@gmail.com
SPRING_MAIL_PASSWORD=hxgj pxdl yjou zfbp
SPRING_MAIL_PROPERTIES_MAIL_SMTP_AUTH=true
SPRING_MAIL_PROPERTIES_MAIL_SMTP_STARTTLS_ENABLE=true
```

### Option 3: Contact Render Support
Ask Render to whitelist Gmail SMTP for your service.

## 🧪 Testing Steps

1. **Test Form Submission** (Currently Working):
   - Go to https://tire-slt.vercel.app
   - Fill and submit tire request form
   - Check if data saves (it should)

2. **Check Backend Status**:
   - https://tire-backend-58a9.onrender.com/health

3. **Email Configuration Check**:
   - https://tire-backend-58a9.onrender.com/api/email-test/config

## 📝 Next Steps

The best approach is to implement **SendGrid** as it's specifically designed for cloud applications and has excellent deliverability rates.
